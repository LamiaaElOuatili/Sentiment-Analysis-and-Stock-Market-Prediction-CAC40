        "title": "Stopping balance sheet reduction is the real lifeline  most people are focusing on interest rate cuts  but ignoring this fatal truth",
        "selftext": "The entire market is betting on a Federal Reserve rate cut at the end of the month  but Powell s statement last night is the real bombshell  signaling a possible early end to the balance sheet reduction  Today  we must expose this crucial truth  overlooked by 97  of investors  Yesterday  Federal Reserve Chairman Powell told 500 fund managers in New York that the balance sheet is on track to be completed  possibly earlier than expected  This translates to the Fed preparing to stop shrinking its balance sheet  However  data from the CM1 exchange shows that 97 3  of traders are suppressing interest rate cuts  while less than 11  of institutions have noticed any changes in the balance sheet reduction  This alarming misconception hides this year s biggest investment misconception  What is balance sheet reduction  Simply put  it s the Fed withdrawing the liquidity it injected previously  Specifically  it involves selling  95 billion in assets   60 billion in Treasury bonds  and  35 billion in mortgage bonds each month  This represents an annual withdrawal of  1 14 trillion in cash from the market  However  the so called 25 basis point rate cut  according to the San Francisco Fed model  only injects approximately  50 billion in liquidity annually  If you take out a calculator now  the amount of funds released by halting balance sheet reduction for one month is equivalent to a full 2 3 times the amount of a 50 basis point interest rate cut  But why is everyone so focused on interest rates  Because rate cuts make headlines \n\nBalance sheet reduction  on the other hand  is hidden in the appendix of financial reports  This collective neglect is creating a dangerous cognitive gap  A look at yesterday s Federal Reserve Beige Book reveals why Powell is so anxious  This national economic health report shows that nine of 12 districts reported soaring corporate financing costs  The Chicago Fed specifically warned of worsening commercial real estate loan defaults  When the Fed sells mortgage bonds  it directly pushes up loan interest rates for shopping malls and office buildings  When it sells Treasury bonds  corporate bond issuance costs also rise  This is why Boston Fed President Collins issued an emergency call this morning regarding market liquidity  which requires closer scrutiny  History always repeats itself  On the eve of Lehman Brothers  collapse in 2008  then Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke couldn t stop the bleeding even after cutting interest rates to zero  Ultimately  it was the initiation of Q1  or reverse balance sheet reduction  that stabilized the financial system  In his speech yesterday  Powell specifically emphasized that monetary policy must prioritize the smooth functioning of markets  This alluded to the painful lessons of September 2019  when aggressive balance sheet reduction sent overnight lending rates soaring to 10   nearly shutting down Wall Street  He s clearly trying to avoid repeating that mistake  and the current market fragmentation reinforces this assessment  On the surface  the US stock market is still rising  but a closer look reveals that this growth is being fueled by seven tech giants  which together account for over 32  of the S P 500 s weighting  The reality revealed by the Beige Book is that small and medium sized businesses are struggling with financing costs  This is like the heart rate monitor in an ICU ward showing a stable heart rate  but the patient s hands and feet are already cold  Halting balance sheet reduction is the true lifeline for the real economy  Even more subversive  halting balance sheet reduction could reshape the entire monetary logic  When the Fed expands its balance sheet again  it effectively loosens the credit of the US dollar  This is exactly what Alan Greenspan did after the 1987 stock market crash  He didn t rush to cut interest rates back then  but instead directly injected liquidity into the market  successfully stemming the spread of the crisis  Powell s approach is now precisely the same  For businesses  this is an even more life or death situation  The Treasury Department issues  1 trillion in bonds every quarter  If the Fed stops selling them  it effectively lowers the government s borrowing costs  Meanwhile  giants like Apple and Microsoft  with  800 billion in cash on hand  will be in for a rude awakening  Increased dollar liquidity means a devaluation of cash  and the money they hold is quietly evaporating  So  when you see the buzz surrounding rate cuts  remember the deeper meaning behind Powell s move  as quoted by Dave Reifsner  Director of Research at the Federal Reserve \n\nA famous governance maxim  When interest rates hit rock bottom  the balance sheet becomes the true policy weapon  This quiet revolution is changing the rules of the game  Rate cuts are fireworks in the spotlight  halting balance sheet reduction is the steel in the supporting wall  This move today will undoubtedly upset some  But it must be said  In the financial world  the most expensive tuition is the cost of cognitive delay  Remember  on the night of October 15  2025  when history turns  some will hear only the wind  while others will see the shape of the storm  Now it s your turn  Are you one of the 97  who are focused on interest rate cuts  or the 11  who understand the implications of balance sheet reduction \n\nProve your perspective in one sentence in the comments section",

 From the peak at  282  I expected a  moderate  pullback of 15  but was kicked in the balls with a 30  drawdown  wiping out  1mil in profits  Dad calls me asking me  should we should sell  I tell him  no  we buy more  and so we did \n\nDespite all the price target raises to  300  PT reiterates at  300  talks of negotiating a new AI deal with Google  high likelihood of settling with Anthropic in mediation  massive earnings beat  and guidance raise far beyond what the Street was expecting  RDDT continued to sell off far beyond a normal range when the rest of the market was continuing to rip to new ATHs day after day  The reduced ChatGPT citation news then came out of nowhere and dropped RDDT another 15  despite having already corrected 15  from the peak  And over the past few days  RDDT continued on the struggle bus with the market ripping \n\nSomething felt off  And so  I decided to add some  wrinkles  to my smoothe brain \n\n\n\n    What My Smoothe Brain Thought Was the   Bear Case\n\n     RDDT was overbought      Sure  the stock had run up a lot  relative strength was high   A cooldown was expected  This might explain a     normal     correction  but not a 30  crash on high volume  Even the 0 revenue quantum stocks hasn t corrected this much in this rate cutting cycle environment  \n    Decrease in DAU   on sites like Semrush \n      Google eliminated the num 100 parameter which broke search result tracking sites and resulted in web traffic drops across all sites    Citizens    even pointed this out in their report  but still no sustainable bounce  \n    ChatGPT reduction in citations   \n      Sam Altman directly indirectly owns 8 7  of RDDT   so a complete reversal of his opinion on reddit seemed unlikely to me  unlike what several headlines and analysts suggested  \n      ChatGPT citations alone don t bring that much traffic to reddit and only account for 5  of RDDT s revenue  so another 15  drop seemed too much especially in the context of a   new deal being negotiated with Google   OpenAI doesn t want Google to have a monopoly relationship over reddit like it does with   Apple  \n      We all learned in high school not to cite Wikipedia  but we still use it because it s useful  Imagine our teachers  faces when reddit comments were being cited by ChatGPT as primary sources  Just because reddit isn t cited  doesn t mean it s not being used at all  \n\nThis entire selloff just seemed too much for RDDT to drop after such stellar earnings and even stronger guidance in this environment where the  MEME ETF    from the grave and ARKK is up 61  YTD  It just didn t make sense \n\nThis was when my smoothe brain formed its first wrinkle  I then remembered there was a non sense hearing scheduled for 10 00am on Oct  8 which I ignored the first time around  It sounded like it d be a meme hearing when I imagined u spez  Gaben  Discord  and Twitch testifying in front of Congress  I also figured out it wasn t going to happen due to the government shutdown as this was the most non essential government hearing that I ve ever heard of \n\nDespite all this  RDDT continued to dump 5  and on Oct  8 right at 10 00am on the day of the originally scheduled hearing when it was clear the hearing was postponed  RDDT bounced  I thought to myself  did we actually bounce because the hearing was canceled    Then it clicked  My second wrinkle   popped into existence  I downed my Red Bulls and put together this timeline \n\n\n\n   Timeline of Events\n\n  9 4   Nepal bans   26 social media platforms\n  9 7  Reddit announces it is  sunsetting public chats  \n  9 8  Start of Nepalese Gen Z  protests organized over Discord  \n  9 9 Nepalese Gen Z protesters  burned alive   the Prime Minister of Nepal s wife\n  9 10  RIP

and closes at  237 45\n  9 29 10 1  RDDT drops from  245 to  202 60 while the rest of the market was breaking to new ATH\n  10 8  RDDT bottoms out at 195 01 at 10 30am  30 minutes after the originally scheduled 10 00am hearing   Antifun  round table discussion led by Trump and other Republicans discuss \n  10 9  RDDT breaks out of the bull flag and begins its road to recovery\n\n\n\n   From Smoothe Brain to Wrinkley Brain\n\nAfter putting together this timeline and matching it up against the way RDDT has been moving over the past 3 weeks  everything made so much more sense  There were enough examples of global radicalism linked to social media  to the point it spooked bulls \n\nThe smart money took profits and the       Bears shorted RDDT bigly  betting that u spez would be crucified at the hearing  At the hearing    Spez would be in a lose lose situation   where his only option would be to confirm that reddit does not allow doxxing  bans users who threaten violence  etc  and   agree to do whatever the Congressional circus   demands him to do  otherwise    they would threaten to remove reddit s      Section 230 immunity     which would   result in reddit being liable   as a publisher for what redditors post    A death sentence    for reddit and all social media companies   \n\nThis would of course be perceived by redditors as a capitulating on free speech  and I m sure many redditors would threaten to leave  Spez also can t pull a Zuck and donate to Trump as this would piss off most redditors even more \n\nThe concession I speculate Spez made was by proactively sunsetting of public chats  While I find this feature is helpful at times for subreddits like r redditstock  I don t use it much personally but I know other redditors love it  What I can see happening is bad actors using it for nefarious purposes  It wouldn t surprise me if there may have been a few  Antifun  individuals who abused this community function which resulted in getting this feature disabled for everyone \n\nIn the context of these outbreaks of violence with social media being used by bad actors  I speculate that Sam Altman  an 8 7  shareholder of RDDT and former reddit CEO of 4 days  may have expedited an update to reduce reddit citations given that only a month prior  reddit was frequently cited making up 41  of LLM citations  Or this was pure coincidence but the timing just seemed a bit sus  Either way  Altman wouldn t want to risk being on Trump s shitlist and risk Trump accusing ChatGPT of being woke due to a high citation percentage of reddit  That would risk development of Star Gate \n\nWhat I completely disagree with is commentary from some analysts who argued that reddit data and OpenAI s relationship with reddit is any less valuable after this change  Reddit is incredibly valuable for sentiment analysis and for verifying if a product with thousands of 5 star reviews is actually legitimate  Like random ass Chinese bluetooth headphones from Xyrbx with a 4 95 rating and over 3 000 reviews  Reddit sentiment analysis would easily flag that as being fake af \n\n\n\n   Testing My Theory\n\nIf my interpretation of the timeline holds true  I thought that one way to test this is to see how META moved during this time  even though they weren t invited for the hearing  And look  META and RDDT s movement look quite similar  The major risk to all social media companies is if Trump were to threaten the removal of Section 230 immunity   But with the  Antifun  terrorist designation  well  that causes an even bigger problem for all social media companies \n\nAMZN  Twitch Hassan Piker  and NFLX  streaming service of Money Heist which popularized the song Bella Ciao which was declared to be the anthem of  Antifun   also moved similarly to RDDT and META since September  All 4 stocks started to recover yesterday as I believe  Antifun  short covering started \n\nAnd if there was a lot of fear with civil uprisings  I thought  why not look into opening up a trade in guns and gold if you have govenment topplings happen  Gun stocks are up 30  from September  and GLD is at the moon  So yes  there was a clear systematic trade that bet on all this and those trades are reversing \n\n\n\n     The Trade Thesis\n\nThe       Bears positioned for an Oct 8 hearing without realizing that the hearing was postponed due to the government shutdown  After seeing that the  Antifun  roundtable didn t trigger a full on collapse below yesterday s support  this signaled that the  Antifun  trade bottomed out and the covering started  Options flow yesterday showed a lot of puts being sold and the return of   Bull whales with    7 5M   in   210 and 220 strike June 2027 calls   which sparked a lot more call buying and confirmation of the bull flag breakout \n\nThere are still a lot more       Bears who haven t made this  Antifun  short connection and still think all of this is related to RDDT being a meme  is no longer useful to AI  and will miss on earnings  They re about to get blown out as   Polymarket puts the shutdown ending after 10 15 at 85  odds    RDDT earnings is on Oct 30  so there is only a limited window for the hearing to be scheduled before earnings  I actually see   RDDT as a hedge for a prolonged shutdown   as this just delays the upcoming hearing \n\nWith   16 18  short interest  RDDT s tiny float  and an earnings blackout period coming up  the time is now to give the       Bears a new gap  With an expected earnings blow out and the hearing having already been priced in  I think we ll break to new ATHs post earnings  I do expect a moderate pullback once the hearing is officially rescheduled but view the hearing as a buy the news event \n\nAfter a new ATH and 2 back to back rate cuts  this would make RDDT a top contender for S P 500 inclusion in the December S P 500 balancing  RDDT was skipped in September despite the 4 consecutive quarters of profit  Just look at how APP and HOOD ripped after the inclusion  Except this would be during the Santa Claus rally and complete index rebalancing in the last trading day of December     \n\n      Conclusion   Make Money Doing What You Love\n\nThere isn t a more wrinkle brain move than to make millions from my 16 years of redditing  If you ve reached the end of this post  ask yourself  What compelled you to read through to the end  Maybe  just maybe  you can add some wrinkles to your brain and make money doing what you love   BECAUSE I FUCKING LOVE REDDIT  I M NEVER GETTING OFF OF REDDIT",

        "selftext": "The absurdity of Tesla knows no bounds  \n\n  Publicly available China sales data  which is about 35  of Tesla s sales   is still down 9  year over year  and Europe sales are still falling  American sales expect a bump due to loss of tax credits  but with Elon s alignment with Trump in the US generally hurting American sales  and significantly increased EV competition in the US  that bump is likely to be marginable at best  Accordingly  Tesla EV sales are still virtually guaranteed to be down year over year this quarter  stagnant at best  Remember  in 2020 Elon and Tesla bulls were projecting a ramp up to 20 million car sales per year  traditional EV sales  not robotaxi sales  by 2030  They ve been stagnant   now decreasing   at under 2 million car sales for over a year now  \n\n\n\n  Worse still  the revenue from automotive regulatory credits will drop to zero starting this quarter  as emissions penalties were eliminated under the Trump administration  Notably  those emissions credits have accounted for  on average  50  of Tesla s net income over the past 5 quarters  and  1Q2025 would have actually had a negative net income of   186 million without the  595 million in income from selling automotive regulatory credits that quarter  \n\n\n\n  And  while robotaxi is interesting and technologically  looks like it s trending towards feasibly working  Tesla still has safety drivers in the markets its operating in  which is mainly Austin at the moment   despite Musk saying it would reach half the U S  population by the end of the year   And  recent autonomous driving disclosures to the NHTSA indicate that in the most recent August month Tesla had 3 accidents for having less than 30 cars on the road  a ratio of 0 3 car month  Waymo  in contrast had 51 incident reports in August for its 1 500 cars on the road across the country  a ratio 0 03 car month and a factor of 10 less incidents per car per month than Tesla  And  while Musk has touted that Tesla is the leader in robotaxi for something like 8 years now  not only has Waymo factually rendered more autonomous rides with dramatically more mileage and  at this point  had demonstrated to be a working technology  but more and more competitors are popping up  such as Zoox in the U S   and pony ai  BYD  and Baidu in Asia  Which is to say  competition is coming  and some would say has already come and surpassed Tesla  for the robotaxi space as well  \n\n\n\n  Additionally  if one takes a step back and compares the robotaxi market to the current ride share market   as that s likely what it will displace since most people that own cars will presumably still want to have their own car   even assuming mature  robust market share and profit margins  the valuation is still probably under  300 range  For example  by my back of the envelope math there were approximately 100 billion ride share miles rendered worldwide in 2024  If you assume Tesla had 50  of that market  which is generally an unheard of market share in a market with decent competitions   Apple  for example  has a 25  global market share   and  assuming that  pursuant to Musk s own projections  the cyber cab was able to get cost per mile down to  0 30 mile  and they charged a reasonable  1 mile to riders  and that does not go lower with more competition  that would give 100 billion miles    0 5 market share     0 70 profit per mile    35 billion profit off of robotaxis per year   35 billion 3 4 billion shares    10 29 per share and giving that a P E of 30 gives you  308 target price  In other words  in a mature industry where Tesla robotaxi s had global reach and 50  market share  and profit margins of 70  per mile  the high price is still only  300 a share  \n\n  Tesla is up 30  this month to  450 a share as of today    and likely trending towards a P E of over 300 as it s EV sales profits are likely trending towards a range of  1 to  2    Gotta love the American stock market",

        "title": "Micron  MU  has lots of room to grow",
        "selftext": "Micron Technology is a global leader in memory and storage solutions  a foundational part of nearly all modern electronics  Over the past six months  Micron s share price has surged by nearly 70 percent  and its year to date gain now stands at over 92 percent  surpassing Wall Street expectations \n\nBehind this rally lies Micron s growing strategic importance in the AI and data center economy \nIts memory chips are increasingly essential for powering artificial intelligence applications  with top tier customers like NVIDIA  Apple  Samsung  and Lenovo relying on Micron s cutting edge technology \n\nTop analysts from Citi  TDCowen  and Deutsche Bank remain bullish ahead of upcoming earnings  pointing to tailwinds from the expanding data center market  which is forecasted to grow by 33 percent annually through 2030  In Q4 2025 alone  analysts expect a staggering 109 percent year over year revenue increase \n\nWith industry momentum  strong financials  and unmatched exposure to AI demand  Micron is shaping up to be one of the strongest long term semiconductor bets of 2025 \n\nDespite Micron s impressive 2025 rally  many investors believe it still trades at a discount to its true value  The key reason is Micron s forward price to earnings ratio remains significantly lower than peers  Its 2026 forward P E of just 9 72x is well below the semiconductor industry average \n\nThis disconnect exists because much of Micron s value lies in its exposure to high bandwidth memory  a crucial technology for powering AI workloads  Micron s HBM product lines are sold out through 2026 and the next generation HBM4 chips are already generating buzz \n\nMicron is evolving from a cyclical chipmaker into a long term growth story  With AI infrastructure booming  its undervaluation won t last much longer \n\nWall Street is focused on Micron ahead of its next earnings release  In recent weeks  Citi \nMizuho  and Susquehanna all raised their price targets  with Citi and Susquehanna now\ntargeting  200 and Mizuho not far behind at  182 \n\nCiti also reiterated its Buy rating  citing stronger than expected demand for AI ready memory chips  Micron s earnings per share expectations have risen accordingly  with investors anticipating continued upside surprises \n\nMicron already delivered an EPS of  3 03 in Q4 2025  significantly beating estimates  and\nanalysts expect the trend to continue  Key themes to watch in the upcoming report include AI product demand  margin guidance  and capacity updates for 2026 \n\nThe AI revolution is triggering a record wave of infrastructure investment  From Microsoft s  30 billion supercomputer project in the UK to Nvidia s backing of OpenAI with up to  100 billion in funding  the scale of global AI investment is massive \n\nMicron sits at the heart of this growth  supplying high bandwidth DRAM and NAND memory required to keep AI models running  With OpenAI s Stargate project planning\nmulti gigawatt scale data centers  Micron s role as a memory provider is becoming even more critical \n\nMicron has even reorganized internally to reflect this shift  aligning its product roadmap to the growing demands of the AI and cloud markets \n\nMicron s financial foundation is solid  The company continues to ramp up R D investment  especially in AI focused memory  while improving profitability  Recent quarters show operating margin expansion  and Micron s R D budget now exceeds historical averages  reflecting its strategy to stay ahead in HBM  DRAM  and NAND technology \n\nThis combination of profitability improvements and innovation spending makes Micron uniquely well positioned to capitalize on future AI cycles \n\nMicron has built a strong track record of earnings performance  consistently delivering beats on EPS and revenue \n\nIn Q4 2025  Micron reported an EPS of  3 03 compared to estimates ranging from  2 53 to\n 2 86  Revenue was  11 3 billion  also above expectations  This marked the third consecutive quarter of double beats in fiscal 2025 \n\nMicron has now beaten expectations for eight straight quarters  This consistency reflects both demand strength and operational execution and has been a key driver of investor confidence \n\nMicron remains attractively valued even after its run up  Its forward P E is 13 4x  well below the sector median of 19 2x  Its forward price to sales ratio near 3 7x is also lower than that of leading AI peers like Nvidia and AMD \nThis valuation gap is notable  especially given Micron s exposure to the same AI megatrends as its higher multiple competitors  Even a re rating to average sector multiples would imply a substantial upside  with some analysts suggesting prices well above  200 per share \nWhile the bullish case for Micron is strong  risks remain  \n\nCompetition from Samsung and SK\nHynix is intensifying  particularly in high bandwidth memory  The memory market itself is highly cyclical and could be affected by any slowdown in AI or cloud infrastructure spending \n\nThere has also been regular insider selling and approximately  200 million in quarterly\nstock based compensation  Although much of this is standard practice in tech and not tied to\nbearish sentiment  it still contributes to dilution  In addition  any missteps in yield  supply chains  or global trade could pressure margins \nMicron holds approximately  11 9 billion in cash and  14 billion in debt  resulting in low net\nleverage  Its investment grade profile gives it the flexibility to raise capital at favorable terms if needed  This reduces reliance on equity and helps limit shareholder dilution \n\nThis financial strength provides a buffer against the memory industry s inherent volatility and\nsupports Micron s long term strategy \nLooking further ahead  Micron s FY2027 forward P E projection is just 10 5x  This sets up an attractive long term buying opportunity  particularly as AI spending is expected to grow\nthroughout the decade \n\nMicron is well positioned to benefit across multiple AI investment cycles  not just a short term surge \n\nFrom a technical perspective  Micron s RSI currently signals overbought conditions  suggesting the stock may cool off in the near term  However  its price remains well above the long term simple moving average  confirming a strong bullish trend \n\nCrucially  the fundamentals support the technical momentum  Robust demand  earnings strength  and favorable industry trends provide a solid foundation  suggesting that any pullbacks may represent long term buying opportunities \n\nGovernments worldwide are investing heavily in AI infrastructure  The United States has\nsupported projects in Wisconsin  Arizona  and Norway  while other nations like the UK  UAE \nand Japan are also building next gen AI facilities \n\nAs a key supplier of high performance memory  Micron stands to benefit from this global infrastructure buildout  Its products are necessary components in nearly every advanced AI deployment on the horizon \nMicron insiders  including CEO Sanjay Mehrotra  regularly sell shares through pre scheduled trading plans  While the lack of insider buying may be seen as a mild negative  it is typical in the tech industry where executives are already highly exposed to company stock \n\nMicron also issues about  200 million in stock based compensation each quarter  While this\ncontributes to modest dilution  it is not excessive compared to other major tech firms and is an accepted tool for attracting and retaining top talent \n\nGiven Micron s growing earnings and market position  this dilution is manageable and does not materially weaken the bullish case \n\nMicron offers a rare combination of explosive earnings growth  AI driven product demand \nattractive valuation  and a strong balance sheet  While competition and market cycles require ongoing attention  the upside potential significantly outweighs the risks \n\nAs Micron continues to execute and deliver results  it remains a strong buy ahead of earnings and into 2026 \n\nInvestor sentiment has been overwhelmingly positive  Retail traders view Micron as one of the leading beneficiaries of the AI boom  and institutional investors are showing strong conviction \n\nHedge funds have increased their stakes and long term investors like pension funds are holding steady \n\nWith confidence from both Wall Street and Main Street  Micron is becoming one of the most widely embraced infrastructure plays in the AI space \n\nThe semiconductor industry is undergoing a transformation powered by AI and data  Micron\nTechnology sits at the center of this shift  As covered throughout this report  Micron s rising\nearnings  leadership in next gen memory  and robust financial position give it a powerful\nlong term edge \n\nThe company is positioning itself for the future of technology  from generative AI to cloud\ncomputing and beyond  Even after a substantial run up in 2025  Micron remains attractively valued with room to grow \n\nAll signs point to Micron Technology being a top semiconductor pick for 2025 and the years\nahead",

        "selftext": "The idea that information is  priced in  is a notoriously tricky concept for new investors  I know I struggled with it for a while   and it occurred to me that a sports betting analogy might help \n\nYou can go out and bet on who is going to win tomorrow s NFL games  but for most of those games  there s a lot of information out there that leads people to expect that one team is more likely to win  Take  for example  tomorrow s Bills Saints game  There s a lot of information suggesting that the Bills are a much better team  and are much more likely than the Saints to win  As a result  if you want to bet that the Bills will win  you re not going to find someone who will take the other side of that bet straight up \n\nTo get someone to take the other side of the bet  you have to concede something  either give them better odds  ie they get a bigger payout if their unlikely bet pays off   or a spread  meaning a number of points that the favored team must win by for the bet to pay out  in this example  the Bills have to win by at least 15 tomorrow  if they win by 7  the people who bet on the Saints get the money   The expectation that the Bills are going to win is priced in  the odds or spread adjust until equal numbers of people are willing to take either side of the bet \n\nThe stock market works the same way  There s a lot of information that leads people to expect that Apple will continue to grow and perform much better than the average company  As a result  to get someone to agree to sell you an Apple share  you have to pay a high price  35 times Apple s current earnings per share  compared to an average of about 26 6 times for the US stock market as a whole   If everyone expects Apple to do better as a company than the market in general  the price of the stock will rise until there s an equal number of buyers and sellers  The expectation that Apple will have above average earnings in the future is already priced in  just like the expectation that the Bills will beat the Saints \n\nEveryone agrees the Bills will probably beat the Saints  To bet on it  you need to have an  even higher conviction  than the consensus  Everyone agrees Apple will probably have better earnings than the average company  To bet on it  ie buying Apple shares instead of a total market index fund   you have to have an  even higher conviction  than the consensus  You can t get rich betting on teams that everyone knows are good  and you can t beat the market buying companies that everyone knows are good  Available information is priced in \n\nEdit  I stopped watching football a while back  so the fact that the Bills are  14 5 vs the Saints is wild to me \n\nEdit2  If you think you have a method for finding mispriced stocks  that s not necessarily in conflict with my point here  The point is that it s more complicated than simply buying companies widely regarded as good  in contrast to what new investors often assume   That said I do tend to be skeptical that retail investors can expect to find a market beating strategy \n\nEdit 3  the Bills won 31 19  meaning that they won the game but did not cover the spread  and people who put money on the Saints won",

        "title": "Duolingo DD",
        "selftext": "Dear  Ladies  gentleman and degenerate market regards\n\nI ve been doing a deep dive into one particular public company called Duolingo  You might be saying  wtf the language learning app    Yes correct  that app with the green owl  A company can be selling dog food for all I care  but if the numbers and the narrative are good  I m buying  That being said  Duolingo   DUOL  is slowly presenting an amazing opportunity as the stock price continues to fall  Opportunities like this is how life changing wealth is made  When everyone is betting on the downfall  you take the other side of that trade and bet against them all  The risk to reward ratio on this is too good to ignore \n\nWould also like to mention  if you re an ape who has been buying into the hype of palantir with a disgusting 600 PE ratio  so high that you might as well buy your local pizza shop thats makes 100k a year for 50 million  then duolingo should not be a problem for you to take a chance on \n\n  The Narrative  \n\nThe bubble has officially popped on Duolingo due to rising fears of competitors entering the market  The two main competitors as of right now are OPENAI  and the tech giant GOOGLE  People are discovering through OpenAi that you can create your own language learning game and are rumoring that people will no longer need duolingo  Google had also announced that they will be entering the language learning app space with google translator utilizing ai for live language conversion  Duolingo did also damage their PR by announcing they would be utilizing AI as well  which the public did not take lightly as they misunderstood it for replacing their employees with AI  Users also had reason to believe that AI will create poor quality content in comparison to having humans manually make the courses which may be true  however  if other companies are in the race utilizing AI for language learning  then Duolingo must compete  Those 3 narratives were enough to pop the bubble of duolingo as it has fallen from  542 to  282 as of today  Can the stock fall further  Yes it can  but it s one of those scenarios where you want it to \n\nThe P E ratio of Duolingo was over 300 at its peak on May 15th 2025  Yes the company was way overvalued at the time for a growth company   a fair valuation for growth companies range between  40 80  however the company is consistently beating earnings expectations and their free cash flow continues to rise higher and higher  Today that P E ratio has dropped to 122 and its price to sales ratio has dropped to 15 1  Yes those numbers still do seem high  but \n\nas their free cash flow continues to rise  that P E ratio will drop into fair valuations  Understand that this company is growing on average 40  year over year  For those who don t understand  markets are always forward looking  The institutions and retail investors who are buying into this company are betting on the fact that the over valuation numbers will drop as they consistently report good earnings  revenue and forward guidance \n\n  The Bull Thesis  \n\nSo before being able to predict the future  you first need to look into the past where history doesn t always repeat itself  but it sure does rhyme  Take a look at the success of Netflix  Even when Amazon  Apple  Disney and Google  youtube  entered the space of video streaming  people thought Netflix would be in serious trouble  In 2011  Amazon announced that they would offer Amazon prime video for free with their subscription  while at the same time Netflix decided to increase their prices by 60   \n\nCustomers were furious and Netflix lost over 800 000 subscribers in 1 quarter  This resulted in their Free cash flow dropping from 59 million in quarter 2 of 2011  to 15 million in quarter 3 of 2011  Eventually their free cash flow did fall into the negatives and recovered in 2013  you can see how the stock follows that on the charts  \n\n  The Moat  \n\nThere is no moat  Just branding   How is this bullish   Well lets think  what s Spotify s moat  What about Netflix  Literally just branding is the moat  so people who think duolingo s demise is due to a lack of a business moat are delusional  It s like saying in the year 2000   why would anyone buy into amazon when anyone can make a website and sell books   fucking regards  \n\n  User Experience  \n\nWhen you look at music streaming services  spotify   SPOT  was the first to the game publicly  Eventually  Apple  Google  youtube   Amazon and about 20 other music streaming platforms nobody gives a fuck about had entered the game  Yet to this day  spotify is what s most popular among them all taking 36  of the music streaming market  Why  User experience is the answer  The spotify platform itself is what carries them and separates them from the rest for both artists and customers  \n\n  The Brand  \n\nThe infamous green owl logo is famous across the world  Duolingo is a world wide icon for language learning  When people hear that  ding   sound completing a duolingo game  everyone knows instantly that it s duolingo  When people ask about learning another language  they instantly point people in the direction of duolingo  It s literally the rank  13 app on the app store for apple and on the front page of  essential apps  \n\n\tWhen people talk to each other about music they ask  what s you re spotify   Nobody asks whats your  apple music  amazon music or youtube music \n\n\tWhen your wife s boyfriend is asking her to come over and watch a movie  he says  netflix and chill  NOT  amazon prime  disney  or apple tv and chill   the fuck \n\nI m listing these examples  because they all have a subscription business model just like duolingo  That being said  duolingo s subscription model is actually better than theirs \n\n  Business Model  \n\nAd revenue and subscriptions  that s it  People pay a yearly subscription for their ability to learn new languages which has been proven to be more effective and enjoyable than any other method through gamification  You got kids who are using this damn app in school  recommended by their teachers and you have parents buying it for their kids  Lets not forget that this company is now going to expand out of just language learning as they have included learning subjects like music  math and chess  \n\nWait  Chess  Wtf  \n\nYes that s exactly what I m thinking  but if you look beyond that  Duolingo is expanding to hit the whole education market  Why pay for chess lessons from elsewhere when you can get it on duolingo with 100  additional learning courses  Ideally  duolingo is expanding into a whole education platform  more directed towards the youth for everything  I wouldn t be surprised if they included courses like science  finance  health etc \n\n\tThey have utilized AI in addition to help the teachers course makers create new courses at a very accelerated pace  Their first 100 courses took them 12 years  Now with AI  they are generating 153 new courses in 1 year \n\n\tThere is NO FRICTION \n\n  No governments regulations trying to stop this\n  No maintenance on their assets  courses \n  No real competition in user experience\n\nAll they have to do is create a great product  a course   add it into their catalog of other courses that comes with the subscription  The more they add  the more incentive there is to go with duolingo instead of buying learning programs elsewhere \n\n  The Bear Thesis  \n\nGo fuck yourself \n\nOn a serious note  looking at Google live translation app which they offer for free  it does seem to be very reliable  but strictly for translating  They claim to be offering language learning practice tools on their google translate app which would be free  Not to mention  there are already over 1 billion downloads of google translate  Comparing it to Duolingo  yes both of them are free  however  google has not announced whether they would  put a pay wall behind learning using their practice tool  However what google is missing in comparison to Duolingo secret formula of success would be gamification  \n\nIf the companies continues to show slower growth  or continues to show a decline in active user for the few quarters  well then  we re fucked  But as of right now  the decline in free cash flow from last quarter to this isn t  catastrophic   but rather a typical overreaction to the narrative  \n\n  External Risks  \n\nRising interest rates  Lets be real  trump is calling for lower interest rates but obviously Jerome Powell doesn t want to follow through with it  In the long term event that they can t afford to lower rates but rather might  increase rates  the broad market does face the risk of a downturn just like in 2022 2023  which of course would most likely add more downward pressure to the stock and market as a whole \n\nAnother external risk that may present itself is a massive bull market in gold  and extreme volatility in government bond markets  more specifically the 10 year yield bonds  For those who don t understand  a massive bull market in gold has always signaled warning signs that something is about to break in the financial system  because gold has always been considered the safe haven asset  Extreme volatility in bond markets signal panic when the yields spread too far apart from the benchmark rate of the federal

years would only be at about 25   If you take a look at the numbers above  the only thing that s under 25  are the monthly active users  The Company is projecting on its forward guidance about 35  YoY growth  which means the stock price is falling towards undervalued territory  The company has been growing at about 45  annually over the past 5 years  so yes a 35  growth on forward guidance does signal a decline in growth  But if you want to take the contrarian approach to the company  believing that AI will accelerate the growth of the company and Google means fuck all  this would be an amazing buying opportunity  \n\nP S  This is not financial advice  I m not a financial advisor  This is just my opinion on my projections of this company s stock price  If you buy high  panic  then sell low  too bad  sucks for you  Would recommend buying and holding the stock as we don t know how long this negative narrative will play out   maybe   WRITING   covered calls OTM for a passive income  If you re a regard and you choose to gamble your life savings   Buying   OTM call options  good luck",

        "selftext": "Around 5 years ago  I posted a similar thread about my lack of understanding on electric vehicles  It brought forward a lot of interesting perspectives on the bull and bear side and I learned a good bit \n\n \n\nToday  I am posting a similar question about AI and how I dont understand the investments we are seeing in AI and more importantly  where does the ROI on this investment come from \n\nI dont think I am putting any opinion out there that isnt already known debated  but my views on AI are pretty straightforward \n\n1  AI has the potential to revolutionize how we live and can disrupt countless industries and long term  will be a huge benefit for society\n2  Like the Industrial Revolution  this disruption will not be met with cheers and excitement  People will be nervous about losing their jobs  wealth inequality being driven further and further  and a deep mistrust of institutions\n3  A large majority of the AI investment by big tech is being driven by advertising revenue cash flow  If we enter a recession or that advertising demand dries up  how much will these large companies be willing to leverage their balance sheets  Look at how much Zuckerberg already has with Meta \n4  Most of this investment will never see a return much less an adequate return on investment  Its very different than the dotcom bubble  With the innovation of some of these chips hardware  some of this AI investment will quickly become obsolete \n5  From an accounting perspective  it feels like companies are understating expenses like depreciation amortization which will further drive down profits  Plus  these business  relationships  you see between Open AI  Oracle  Nvidia  etc    is it just glorified ribbon cutting  Is any value being driven through these deals besides seeing the 5 10  bump in your stock price the next day  It seems the whole industry is mostly just signing deals between 5 6 companies and moving money around on a spreadsheet  \n6  China is just as much in this arena as we are  Back in the dotcom era  American Exceptionalism drove a lot of the investment in the US in the late 90s because there werent great alternatives  In today s world  that isnt the case  You have a China competitor that has proven it cant just go toe to toe with you  but can straight up beat you  If this race comes down to building  the US will lose  We already have lost the great energy race of the 2010s and is there any doubt that China will do what China always does  Drive margins down  reduce profitability  and ensure only the fittest survive  In todays market  you have Chinese tech companies that can compete with the Google  Meta  etc \n7  History suggests that the dominant players today might not be the dominant players of tomorrow  Part of that is not innovating and getting beaten by a smaller and more nimble version  Part of it is making poor investment  rushing to a gold rush with no gold  and eliminating any flexibility you had \n8  I see dozens of companies throwing billions at this AI infrastructure   data center build  components to cool the data centers  chips  nuclear energy  etc  How many of these companies completely lose out and see a 90  draw down like the past cycles such as electric vehicles  Tesla aside  \n9  We dont have the power grid in the US to handle this new generation of AI investment  I read and hear good things about expanding the grid  SMRs  and that s great  but does anyone actually expect us to build all of this energy  Im pretty sure China builds more energy capacity in a month than we have in years  That isnt an easy trend to reverse \n10  How does the US government help hurt this  Increased state regulation  Limiting immigration of top AI researchers entrepreneurs  Slow rolling electric power expansion  Picking winners and losers and disrupting the free market \n11  Will American companies focus on every day improvements to life or these content creating opportunities in AI  I saw Open AI launch a new thing with virtual content creating and that s great  but I have to admit  i asked myself  is that really the best the best minds in AI can do  Are American companies going to go for the easiest marketable and content creating areas of AI instead of the truly ground breaking areas  Will that area be dominated by China \n\nThis has become kind of a rant  and I apologize  but I am just curious  How do you see the AI cycle and how are you playing it  Im looking at companies that have been beaten up due to AI fears and selling call spreads  and other option players to take advantage of these high flying companies  I never short companies like AI high fliers",

        "title": "Stopping balance sheet reduction is the real lifeline  most people are focusing on interest rate cuts  but ignoring this fatal truth",
        "selftext": "The entire market is betting on a Federal Reserve rate cut at the end of the month  but Powell s statement last night is the real bombshell  signaling a possible early end to the balance sheet reduction  Today  we must expose this crucial truth  overlooked by 97  of investors  Yesterday  Federal Reserve Chairman Powell told 500 fund managers in New York that the balance sheet is on track to be completed  possibly earlier than expected  This translates to the Fed preparing to stop shrinking its balance sheet  However  data from the CM1 exchange shows that 97 3  of traders are suppressing interest rate cuts  while less than 11  of institutions have noticed any changes in the balance sheet reduction  This alarming misconception hides this year s biggest investment misconception  What is balance sheet reduction  Simply put  it s the Fed withdrawing the liquidity it injected previously  Specifically  it involves selling  95 billion in assets   60 billion in Treasury bonds  and  35 billion in mortgage bonds each month  This represents an annual withdrawal of  1 14 trillion in cash from the market  However  the so called 25 basis point rate cut  according to the San Francisco Fed model  only injects approximately  50 billion in liquidity annually  If you take out a calculator now  the amount of funds released by halting balance sheet reduction for one month is equivalent to a full 2 3 times the amount of a 50 basis point interest rate cut  But why is everyone so focused on interest rates  Because rate cuts make headlines \n\nBalance sheet reduction  on the other hand  is hidden in the appendix of financial reports  This collective neglect is creating a dangerous cognitive gap  A look at yesterday s Federal Reserve Beige Book reveals why Powell is so anxious  This national economic health report shows that nine of 12 districts reported soaring corporate financing costs  The Chicago Fed specifically warned of worsening commercial real estate loan defaults  When the Fed sells mortgage bonds  it directly pushes up loan interest rates for shopping malls and office buildings  When it sells Treasury bonds  corporate bond issuance costs also rise  This is why Boston Fed President Collins issued an emergency call this morning regarding market liquidity  which requires closer scrutiny  History always repeats itself  On the eve of Lehman Brothers  collapse in 2008  then Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke couldn t stop the bleeding even after cutting interest rates to zero  Ultimately  it was the initiation of Q1  or reverse balance sheet reduction  that stabilized the financial system  In his speech yesterday  Powell specifically emphasized that monetary policy must prioritize the smooth functioning of markets  This alluded to the painful lessons of September 2019  when aggressive balance sheet reduction sent overnight lending rates soaring to 10   nearly shutting down Wall Street  He s clearly trying to avoid repeating that mistake  and the current market fragmentation reinforces this assessment  On the surface  the US stock market is still rising  but a closer look reveals that this growth is being fueled by seven tech giants  which together account for over 32  of the S P 500 s weighting  The reality revealed by the Beige Book is that small and medium sized businesses are struggling with financing costs  This is like the heart rate monitor in an ICU ward showing a stable heart rate  but the patient s hands and feet are already cold  Halting balance sheet reduction is the true lifeline for the real economy  Even more subversive  halting balance sheet reduction could reshape the entire monetary logic  When the Fed expands its balance sheet again  it effectively loosens the credit of the US dollar  This is exactly what Alan Greenspan did after the 1987 stock market crash  He didn t rush to cut interest rates back then  but instead directly injected liquidity into the market  successfully stemming the spread of the crisis  Powell s approach is now precisely the same  For businesses  this is an even more life or death situation  The Treasury Department issues  1 trillion in bonds every quarter  If the Fed stops selling them  it effectively lowers the government s borrowing costs  Meanwhile  giants like Apple and Microsoft  with  800 billion in cash on hand  will be in for a rude awakening  Increased dollar liquidity means a devaluation of cash  and the money they hold is quietly evaporating  So  when you see the buzz surrounding rate cuts  remember the deeper meaning behind Powell s move  as quoted by Dave Reifsner  Director of Research at the Federal Reserve \n\nA famous governance maxim  When interest rates hit rock bottom  the balance sheet becomes the true policy weapon  This quiet revolution is changing the rules of the game  Rate cuts are fireworks in the spotlight  halting balance sheet reduction is the steel in the supporting wall  This move today will undoubtedly upset some  But it must be said  In the financial world  the most expensive tuition is the cost of cognitive delay  Remember  on the night of October 15  2025  when history turns  some will hear only the wind  while others will see the shape of the storm  Now it s your turn  Are you one of the 97  who are focused on interest rate cuts  or the 11  who understand the implications of balance sheet reduction \n\nProve your perspective in one sentence in the comments section",

        "selftext": "Greetings fellow crayon eaters  if you ve been missing this AI bubble that is just getting started  then you re a pathetic loser   BUT you re in luck   because i m here to present you with a play that is ready to run 1000   and is actually  dare i say  UNDERVALUED in this market environment  Only up 18  YTD  Pathetic  This has the potential for upwards of    40 50      THIS YEAR   \n\nThe ticker   PATH\n\nAnd it s your PATH to finally getting a  taste of the big gains this market has to offer \n\n  What the fuck does PATH do   \n\nIn short  PATH builds Robotic Process Automations  RPAs  to automate repetitive tasks  Meaning  path will probably build the AI that runs the robot that replaces you  so hopefully your wife s boyfriend can support you both  For more details  search the fucking internet  idiot  I gotta keep it short enough for your attention span  \n\n  Why is PATH so beaten up   \n\nIt came too early   just like you   loser  \n\nPATH went public in 2021 at  65 50 per share  It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood  and pumped to an all time high of 90  BUTTT   the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer  Robotics and AI  If you re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021  the hype was EVs and green energy  Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics  Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks  PATH was a victim of that \n\nThe nail in the coffin was May 29  2024  when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance  The stock dropped 30  that day and still has a gap there  Aunt Cathie ended up selling for a loss   you know what that means   \n\nSince then it found a floor of  10 a share which it has tested multiple times \n\n\n\n  Today is a completely different story   \n\nPATH has stumbled into a fucking golden opportunity   AI  robotics  and automation  They have weathered the storm of CEO change  and have established reliable income streams \n\n  2025 Partnerships   \n\n  As of October 2025  PATH has established new partnerships with   \n\n  Nvidia  OpenAI  Salesforce  and Snowflake  Yeah thats right  the motherfucking work horses of the modern market  NVDA and OPENAI  \n\nThis is IN ADDITION to their existing partnerships and clients  Microsoft  Google Cloud  SAP  and Amazon  \n\n  Earnings trends     PATH has beat revenue expectations 8 times in a row  and beat EPS expectations 7 of the last 8 earnings   \n\n\n\n  What s next   \n\nPATH has projected both EPS and revenue growth  The best part  Projections have not been raised since the new partnerships  meaning PATH is poised to surprise to the upside for earnings in December  and the market is  just now beginning to price that in  \n\n  TA   Options pricing   THIS IS BIG  \n\nBullish all time macD reversal with a gap to fill at  19  Resistance at 15  but setup to break through it after four tests by bulls in the past year  and recently with incredible volume not seen since the gap down from the CEO leaving  indicating big money is poised to capture the upside  \n\n   IV is considerably low at for at the money options when compared to the IV of other AI stocks  it s currently sitting at 60 75   This is HUGE  Options are currently critically undervalued for a stock that is poised to break to the upside and be major AI play for the year     \n\nIn comparison  other market AI darlings like RZLV iv 141  for at the money  APLD 137   SOUN 110   RR 190 \n\n For you smooth brains  this means call option prices have room to absolutely skyrocket once this breaks out   \n\nCurrent short interest per fintel is 12   Short interest can help drive the upside breakout as shorts look to exit near 5 year lows as Bulls once again take charge \n\nSince dropping to  10 a share  we can see from the volume profile that there has been significant accumulation of shares in the  10 14 range  and we are just beginning to break away from that into a volume gap that will eventually take the stock into the  20 s\n\nIt s just broken over the 200D MA and backtested it  bouncing hard following a small dip from profit taking after the NVDA partnership announcement \n\n Just like your mom  it s desperate to have it s gap filled  \n\n  Share ownership    76  of shares owned by institutions\n\n\n\n  Ziptrader    800k subs on youtube  made PATH his  1 pick\n\n  My Position    November  December  and January calls   shares  Planning to add more  as the calls are still very cheap compared to other AI or robotics stocks  I m using my gambling account  and I got permission from my wife s boyfriend to use her account and start another position \n\n\n\n\n\n  TLDR  PATH is an established player in AI and Robotics  has signed major deals with NVDA  openAI  CRM  SNOW  and MSFT  but the stock price has not reflected their potential growth  PT  50   \n\n  \n  UPDATE  10 15 2025  \n\nTrump Tariff Tape Bomb on 10 10 25 Made me take profit on November December calls  Up  30k\n\nStill Holding January Calls below  and shares  Will look to add to position again as market recovers",

        "title": "Micron  MU  has lots of room to grow",
        "selftext": "Micron Technology is a global leader in memory and storage solutions  a foundational part of nearly all modern electronics  Over the past six months  Micron s share price has surged by nearly 70 percent  and its year to date gain now stands at over 92 percent  surpassing Wall Street expectations \n\nBehind this rally lies Micron s growing strategic importance in the AI and data center economy \nIts memory chips are increasingly essential for powering artificial intelligence applications  with top tier customers like NVIDIA  Apple  Samsung  and Lenovo relying on Micron s cutting edge technology \n\nTop analysts from Citi  TDCowen  and Deutsche Bank remain bullish ahead of upcoming earnings  pointing to tailwinds from the expanding data center market  which is forecasted to grow by 33 percent annually through 2030  In Q4 2025 alone  analysts expect a staggering 109 percent year over year revenue increase \n\nWith industry momentum  strong financials  and unmatched exposure to AI demand  Micron is shaping up to be one of the strongest long term semiconductor bets of 2025 \n\nDespite Micron s impressive 2025 rally  many investors believe it still trades at a discount to its true value  The key reason is Micron s forward price to earnings ratio remains significantly lower than peers  Its 2026 forward P E of just 9 72x is well below the semiconductor industry average \n\nThis disconnect exists because much of Micron s value lies in its exposure to high bandwidth memory  a crucial technology for powering AI workloads  Micron s HBM product lines are sold out through 2026 and the next generation HBM4 chips are already generating buzz \n\nMicron is evolving from a cyclical chipmaker into a long term growth story  With AI infrastructure booming  its undervaluation won t last much longer \n\nWall Street is focused on Micron ahead of its next earnings release  In recent weeks  Citi \nMizuho  and Susquehanna all raised their price targets  with Citi and Susquehanna now\ntargeting  200 and Mizuho not far behind at  182 \n\nCiti also reiterated its Buy rating  citing stronger than expected demand for AI ready memory chips  Micron s earnings per share expectations have risen accordingly  with investors anticipating continued upside surprises \n\nMicron already delivered an EPS of  3 03 in Q4 2025  significantly beating estimates  and\nanalysts expect the trend to continue  Key themes to watch in the upcoming report include AI product demand  margin guidance  and capacity updates for 2026 \n\nThe AI revolution is triggering a record wave of infrastructure investment  From Microsoft s  30 billion supercomputer project in the UK to Nvidia s backing of OpenAI with up to  100 billion in funding  the scale of global AI investment is massive \n\nMicron sits at the heart of this growth  supplying high bandwidth DRAM and NAND memory required to keep AI models running  With OpenAI s Stargate project planning\nmulti gigawatt scale data centers  Micron s role as a memory provider is becoming even more critical \n\nMicron has even reorganized internally to reflect this shift  aligning its product roadmap to the growing demands of the AI and cloud markets \n\nMicron s financial foundation is solid  The company continues to ramp up R D investment  especially in AI focused memory  while improving profitability  Recent quarters show operating margin expansion  and Micron s R D budget now exceeds historical averages  reflecting its strategy to stay ahead in HBM  DRAM  and NAND technology \n\nThis combination of profitability improvements and innovation spending makes Micron uniquely well positioned to capitalize on future AI cycles \n\nMicron has built a strong track record of earnings performance  consistently delivering beats on EPS and revenue \n\nIn Q4 2025  Micron reported an EPS of  3 03 compared to estimates ranging from  2 53 to\n 2 86  Revenue was  11 3 billion  also above expectations  This marked the third consecutive quarter of double beats in fiscal 2025 \n\nMicron has now beaten expectations for eight straight quarters  This consistency reflects both demand strength and operational execution and has been a key driver of investor confidence \n\nMicron remains attractively valued even after its run up  Its forward P E is 13 4x  well below the sector median of 19 2x  Its forward price to sales ratio near 3 7x is also lower than that of leading AI peers like Nvidia and AMD \nThis valuation gap is notable  especially given Micron s exposure to the same AI megatrends as its higher multiple competitors  Even a re rating to average sector multiples would imply a substantial upside  with some analysts suggesting prices well above  200 per share \nWhile the bullish case for Micron is strong  risks remain  \n\nCompetition from Samsung and SK\nHynix is intensifying  particularly in high bandwidth memory  The memory market itself is highly cyclical and could be affected by any slowdown in AI or cloud infrastructure spending \n\nThere has also been regular insider selling and approximately  200 million in quarterly\nstock based compensation  Although much of this is standard practice in tech and not tied to\nbearish sentiment  it still contributes to dilution  In addition  any missteps in yield  supply chains  or global trade could pressure margins \nMicron holds approximately  11 9 billion in cash and  14 billion in debt  resulting in low net\nleverage  Its investment grade profile gives it the flexibility to raise capital at favorable terms if needed  This reduces reliance on equity and helps limit shareholder dilution \n\nThis financial strength provides a buffer against the memory industry s inherent volatility and\nsupports Micron s long term strategy \nLooking further ahead  Micron s FY2027 forward P E projection is just 10 5x  This sets up an attractive long term buying opportunity  particularly as AI spending is expected to grow\nthroughout the decade \n\nMicron is well positioned to benefit across multiple AI investment cycles  not just a short term surge \n\nFrom a technical perspective  Micron s RSI currently signals overbought conditions  suggesting the stock may cool off in the near term  However  its price remains well above the long term simple moving average  confirming a strong bullish trend \n\nCrucially  the fundamentals support the technical momentum  Robust demand  earnings strength  and favorable industry trends provide a solid foundation  suggesting that any pullbacks may represent long term buying opportunities \n\nGovernments worldwide are investing heavily in AI infrastructure  The United States has\nsupported projects in Wisconsin  Arizona  and Norway  while other nations like the UK  UAE \nand Japan are also building next gen AI facilities \n\nAs a key supplier of high performance memory  Micron stands to benefit from this global infrastructure buildout  Its products are necessary components in nearly every advanced AI deployment on the horizon \nMicron insiders  including CEO Sanjay Mehrotra  regularly sell shares through pre scheduled trading plans  While the lack of insider buying may be seen as a mild negative  it is typical in the tech industry where executives are already highly exposed to company stock \n\nMicron also issues about  200 million in stock based compensation each quarter  While this\ncontributes to modest dilution  it is not excessive compared to other major tech firms and is an accepted tool for attracting and retaining top talent \n\nGiven Micron s growing earnings and market position  this dilution is manageable and does not materially weaken the bullish case \n\nMicron offers a rare combination of explosive earnings growth  AI driven product demand \nattractive valuation  and a strong balance sheet  While competition and market cycles require ongoing attention  the upside potential significantly outweighs the risks \n\nAs Micron continues to execute and deliver results  it remains a strong buy ahead of earnings and into 2026 \n\nInvestor sentiment has been overwhelmingly positive  Retail traders view Micron as one of the leading beneficiaries of the AI boom  and institutional investors are showing strong conviction \n\nHedge funds have increased their stakes and long term investors like pension funds are holding steady \n\nWith confidence from both Wall Street and Main Street  Micron is becoming one of the most widely embraced infrastructure plays in the AI space \n\nThe semiconductor industry is undergoing a transformation powered by AI and data  Micron\nTechnology sits at the center of this shift  As covered throughout this report  Micron s rising\nearnings  leadership in next gen memory  and robust financial position give it a powerful\nlong term edge \n\nThe company is positioning itself for the future of technology  from generative AI to cloud\ncomputing and beyond  Even after a substantial run up in 2025  Micron remains attractively valued with room to grow \n\nAll signs point to Micron Technology being a top semiconductor pick for 2025 and the years\nahead",

guidance \n\nEPS   2 90   beats revised  2 85 guide \n\nGross Margin  45    tight supply   strong DRAM HBM pricing \n\nGuidance  Raised again for FY2026  pointing to sustained AI cloud

 120  130\n\nThe biggest risk I see is the cyclical narrative but given the demand this year and how we are seeing AI and data centers scaling up  I think we have reached a point where the market transitions from cyclical to more secular  \n\nRight now PE is  24 25 with the drop but if EPS expectation is hit  10 12 for FY 2026  and PE drops to 18 20 we are still looking at  200  price target  I believe  175 185 is a lower range \n\nOf course this all depends on how Micron Management forward guidance looks but I think we are in for a surprise  \n\nGood luck",

        "selftext": "Greetings fellow crayon eaters  if you ve been missing this AI bubble that is just getting started  then you re a pathetic loser   BUT you re in luck   because i m here to present you with a play that is ready to run 1000   and is actually  dare i say  UNDERVALUED in this market environment  Only up 18  YTD  Pathetic  This has the potential for upwards of    40 50      THIS YEAR   \n\nThe ticker   PATH\n\nAnd it s your PATH to finally getting a  taste of the big gains this market has to offer \n\n  What the fuck does PATH do   \n\nIn short  PATH builds Robotic Process Automations  RPAs  to automate repetitive tasks  Meaning  path will probably build the AI that runs the robot that replaces you  so hopefully your wife s boyfriend can support you both  For more details  search the fucking internet  idiot  I gotta keep it short enough for your attention span  \n\n  Why is PATH so beaten up   \n\nIt came too early   just like you   loser  \n\nPATH went public in 2021 at  65 50 per share  It was seen as a next generation darling by Aunt Cathie Wood  and pumped to an all time high of 90  BUTTT   the overall market and economy was not ready for what PATH had to offer  Robotics and AI  If you re not brainrotted too much to remember 2021  the hype was EVs and green energy  Nobody gave a shit about AI or robotics  Then the 2022 bear market came and wiped the speculative stocks  PATH was a victim of that \n\nThe nail in the coffin was May 29  2024  when the company announced a CEO change and lowered their yearly guidance  The stock dropped 30  that day and still has a gap there  Aunt Cathie ended up selling for a loss   you know what that means   \n\nSince then it found a floor of  10 a share which it has tested multiple times \n\n\n\n  Today is a completely different story   \n\nPATH has stumbled into a fucking golden opportunity   AI  robotics  and automation  They have weathered the storm of CEO change  and have established reliable income streams \n\n  2025 Partnerships   \n\n  As of October 2025  PATH has established new partnerships with   \n\n  Nvidia  OpenAI  Salesforce  and Snowflake  Yeah thats right  the motherfucking work horses of the modern market  NVDA and OPENAI  \n\nThis is IN ADDITION to their existing partnerships and clients  Microsoft  Google Cloud  SAP  and Amazon  \n\n  Earnings trends     PATH has beat revenue expectations 8 times in a row  and beat EPS expectations 7 of the last 8 earnings   \n\n\n\n  What s next   \n\nPATH has projected both EPS and revenue growth  The best part  Projections have not been raised since the new partnerships  meaning PATH is poised to surprise to the upside for earnings in December  and the market is  just now beginning to price that in  \n\n  TA   Options pricing   THIS IS BIG  \n\nBullish all time macD reversal with a gap to fill at  19  Resistance at 15  but setup to break through it after four tests by bulls in the past year  and recently with incredible volume not seen since the gap down from the CEO leaving  indicating big money is poised to capture the upside  \n\n   IV is considerably low at for at the money options when compared to the IV of other AI stocks  it s currently sitting at 60 75   This is HUGE  Options are currently critically undervalued for a stock that is poised to break to the upside and be major AI play for the year     \n\nIn comparison  other market AI darlings like RZLV iv 141  for at the money  APLD 137   SOUN 110   RR 190 \n\n For you smooth brains  this means call option prices have room to absolutely skyrocket once this breaks out   \n\nCurrent short interest per fintel is 12   Short interest can help drive the upside breakout as shorts look to exit near 5 year lows as Bulls once again take charge \n\nSince dropping to  10 a share  we can see from the volume profile that there has been significant accumulation of shares in the  10 14 range  and we are just beginning to break away from that into a volume gap that will eventually take the stock into the  20 s\n\nIt s just broken over the 200D MA and backtested it  bouncing hard following a small dip from profit taking after the NVDA partnership announcement \n\n Just like your mom  it s desperate to have it s gap filled  \n\n  Share ownership    76  of shares owned by institutions\n\n\n\n  Ziptrader    800k subs on youtube  made PATH his  1 pick\n\n  My Position    November  December  and January calls   shares  Planning to add more  as the calls are still very cheap compared to other AI or robotics stocks  I m using my gambling account  and I got permission from my wife s boyfriend to use her account and start another position \n\n\n\n\n\n  TLDR  PATH is an established player in AI and Robotics  has signed major deals with NVDA  openAI  CRM  SNOW  and MSFT  but the stock price has not reflected their potential growth  PT  50   \n\n  \n  UPDATE  10 15 2025  \n\nTrump Tariff Tape Bomb on 10 10 25 Made me take profit on November December calls  Up  30k\n\nStill Holding January Calls below  and shares  Will look to add to position again as market recovers",

        "selftext": "1  Corporate jobs  white collar  office jobs  working for corporations    this has already been revealed as a scam career nobody thinks seriously about since how companies use AI to layoff people \n\nI would not invest my career path into being a cog in the corporate machine \nLayoffs  optimizing quarterly earnings by offshoring  and AI are taking over \nIn my opinion  these jobs are too risky  The ultimate goal of corporations is to cut costs on employees  pay them as little as possible while keeping them from quitting  and maintain a constant large supply of workers  including migrants  to create endless competition and an employer s market \n\nIt s very risky to invest in corporate jobs  I would stay away  even if today tech  finance  etc  offer good salarie because your job existence depends on whether the corporation wants you or not  It s a pointless career in the era of AI \n\n  2  Independent career paths  \n\nJobs and professions where your clients are ordinary people and you control how much you work and who you work for  Dentists  nurses  hairdressers  car mechanics  builders  plumbers \nServices you provide directly to ordinary people  work independent from boss and managers \n\n  3  Small business owners  \nAgain  independent jobs outside the traditional 9 5 corporate slavery  without bullshit like time tracking and annual performance reviews  Local pizzerias  restaurants  beauty salons  electronic shops  food shops  etc \n\n  4  Marketing and influencing  \n\nHaving a large following userbase  being public and visible on the internet  building a community  being a YouTuber   with 100k  subscribers \nWhy  Because it allows you to leverage that audience to create businesses you already have a ready user base \n\n  5  Innovations against capitalism and corporate culture  \n\nSince the job market is terrible and will be even worse in the future  all innovation around fighting consumerism  anti capitalism  and small alternatives  to McDonald s  Amazon  Facebook etc   will grow  20 years ago  these companies were liked by people because they were innovative and helped improve people s lives  Now they hoard all the profits for themselves and harm society  the economy  and the job market  People hate large companies now  and they will be seeking friendly  ethical  anticapitalistic alternatives who share profits with ordinary people and make their life better \n\nIn the future  angry people who lost their jobs due to AI will also move away from large corporations  Just like iPhones will become outdated the way BlackBerry phones did  alternatives to Amazon and other corporate giants will emerge \n\nThe next trend is anticonsumerism  All innovations that provide alternatives to AI  big corporations  and consumerism will grow  This is especially visible in Gen Z and Gen Alpha  Being poor and frugal will be cool  A few years ago  people admired influencers and celebrities now they hate them for flaunting luxury lives they ll never have \n\nPreviously  wearing Louis Vitton and rolex was considered impressive  but now people laugh at that  Wearing Temu clothes is seen as cooler because everyone knows buying overpriced products is for losers  Among the younger generation  wearing Louis vitton or riding a porsche isn t a flex anymore  it s cringe  People despise these status symbols  seeing them as losers tricked into buying overpriced corporate bullshit that s worth  1 instead of the  10 000 they paid \n\n  6  Loneliness epidemic  \n\nThis is a huge problem  Right now people replace their social contact with tiktok and social media  but even though they use it  they still crave real human connections  Anything  businesses or innovations that solves this problem and unites the younger generation could be the next airbnb level innovation \n\n  7  Squeezing money from services for the middle class and rich  \n\nAll the work and services where the rich are consumers will provide a lot of money  Cleaning their houses  quality food for the wealthy  nannies  spas  luxury brands  etc  Prices for services targeting the rich will rise \nJust like corporations raise prices for products while cutting labor costs  people providing direct services for the rich  cleaning ladies  nannies  food delivery  spas  etc   will raise their rates  squeezing money from the rich  People hate the rich and will overvalue these services as a way to get money back  \n\n  8  Investing in stocks  \n\nI believe the UBI of our time will be investing in stocks guaranteed profit in the era of AI  On one hand  we can hate AI as corporate robbery used to lay off people  But on the other hand  we can ride the wave and invest in their stocks \n\nThe recession isn t coming in the next 10 years  corporations have everything in place now  The poor will struggle  but the capital market doesn t care  Capital markets exist to make money \n\nInvesting  especially in AI companies  is a safe bet  Ordinary people may dislike AI  but billionaires are already pouring money into it and will continue to  Large cap stocks at this point are like a safe UBI with 20 30  YoY gains \n\nWhat do the rich do if they want more money  They invest in stocks  Years ago  the stock market saw recessions  20  drops  Black Mondays  banking crises  etc  Now the stock market doesn t even react to that  The rich pour their money into stocks because they re too lazy to create something new with real value they just click  buy stocks  and do nothing while their capital multiplies",

competitive position and solid execution delivered record revenue in fiscal Q3  with revenue  gross margin and EPS all exceeding the high end of our guidance ranges     Sanjay Mehrotra  CEO    \n\n Data center revenue more than doubled year over year and reached a record level  and consumer oriented markets had strong sequential growth     Mehrotra    \n\t\n We generated substantial free cash flow in the quarter  even as we continue to make strategic investments critical to sustain long term growth     Mehrotra    \n\t\n Micron delivered record revenue in fiscal Q3  driven by all time high DRAM revenue including nearly 50  sequential growth in HBM revenue     Mehrotra    \n\n We are on track to deliver record revenue with solid profitability and free cash flow in fiscal 2025  while we invest to build on our leadership to address growing AI driven memory demand     Mehrotra    \n\n Fiscal Q3 DRAM revenue was  7 1 billion  up 51  year over year  and represented 76  of total revenue  Sequentially  DRAM revenue increased 15   with bit shipments increasing over 20  and prices decreasing in the low single digit percentage range  primarily due to a higher consumer oriented revenue mix     Mark Murphy  CFO    \n\n NAND revenue was  2 2 billion   Sequentially  NAND revenue increased 16   with bit shipments increasing in the mid 20s percentage range and prices decreasing in the high single digit percentage range     Murphy    \n\n Gross margin   was above the high end of our guidance range  primarily due to better prices for both DRAM and NAND  partially offset by a higher consumer oriented mix     CFO Murphy    \n\t\n Ending inventory for fiscal Q3 was  8 7 billion  or 139 days  Inventory was down  280 million sequentially  and inventory days were down 19 days sequentially  driven by strong sequential bit shipment growth in both DRAM and NAND     Murphy    \n\t\nGuidance for Q4 \n We expect revenue of  10 7 billion    300 million  gross margin non GAAP of  42    1   operating expenses approx  1 2 billion    20 million  non GAAP EPS of   2 50    0 15 per share     Micron management    \n\n With another quarter of shipment growth forecasted in fiscal Q4  we expect to exit fiscal 2025 with tight DRAM inventories  significantly reduced NAND inventories and overall company DIO near our target levels  With low inventories on hand and a constructive demand environment  we will continue to focus on improving pricing and further strengthening our product mix     Management    \n\nSource   \n\nTLDR\n\nBest Case  Bullish \n\nRevenue    11 2B   above top of guidance \n\nEPS   2 90   beats revised  2 85 guide \n\nGross Margin  45    tight supply   strong DRAM HBM pricing \n\nGuidance  Raised again for FY2026  pointing to sustained AI cloud demand\n\t\nStock Impact  Could rally  20 30   pushing toward  180  200 as analysts hike targets\n\nWorst Case  Bearish \n\nRevenue     11 0B  below guide midpoint \n\nEPS     2 70  miss vs Street   2 78  2 85 \n\nMargins  Slip toward 42 43   pricing softness  higher costs \n\nGuidance  Conservative  signaling slower demand or inventory concerns\n\nStock Impact  Could drop  10 25   retracing toward  120  130\n\nThe biggest risk I see is the cyclical narrative but given the demand this year and how we are seeing AI and data centers scaling up  I think we have reached a point where the market transitions from cyclical to more secular  \n\nRight now PE is  24 25 with the drop but if EPS expectation is hit  10 12 for FY 2026  and PE drops to 18 20 we are still looking at  200  price target  I believe  175 185 is a lower range \n\nOf course this all depends on how Micron Management forward guidance looks but I think we are in for a surprise  \n\nGood luck",

        "selftext": "EDIT    \n  \n  \nAfter Paramount CEO David Ellison s  presumptive all cash bid for Warner Bros  Discovery   Puck s Dylan Byers has followed up to reveal that  a well placed Hollywood source called to suggest         that Netflix was also considering a bid for David Zaslav s   WBD CEO and president   assets  \n\n Byers acknowledges that this scenario was once  implausible   but that  Ellison s seemingly limitless cash and ambition have accelerated Hollywood s consolidation process  and his decision to bid for all of WBD now in an attempt to preempt potential rivals is forcing nearly everyone to dust off their models  \n\n These potential bids are coming after Warner Bros   historic summer with a streak of successful movies at the box office  However  Puck reports that Steven Cahall of Wells Fargo  does not expect WBD stock price to move much beyond  19 a share  and that  neither Apple nor Amazon will go for all of WBD  \n\n Thinking along the lines that Netflix would be interested only in Warner Bros   studio and streaming operations  Byers says           as I discussed on Sunday  Zaz would need to convince his board and WBD shareholders that there would be more value coming from the split than from the Ellisons that two in the bush is worth more than a bird in hand  \n\n As far as what Paramount s possibly buying Warner Bros  means  the merging of two of Hollywood s oldest studios could result in a powerful new institution in the industry  Ellison seemingly wants to go all in on this idea  as his goal is to buy all of Warner Bros   assets  including games  comics  and more  Netflix s offer might mean splitting up parts of the company \n\nTL DR   they probably want to spin off parts of WBD which may be a tougher sell to their shareholders than a huge bag of   from the Ellisons for the whole thing \n\nSeems like Netflix is trying to take a final stab at grabbing part of WBD before they sell to PSKY  Ellisons offered  22 24 share  think some analysts were calling 21 share bullish so my take away is that the Ellisons seem likely to get this done",
